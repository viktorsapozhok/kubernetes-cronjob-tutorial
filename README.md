# kubernetes-cronjob-tutorial

This repository provides a demo on how to deploy cron jobs to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

You learn how to: 

* Prepare a Python app for deployment to AKS and build a docker image.
* Create an Azure container registry and push images to the registry.
* Create and configure a Kubernetes cluster, scale it down to zero with autoscaler.
* Schedule and deploy jobs to Kubernetes cluster.

Read the [tutorial][1] for more.

## 1. Clone the application

The application used in this tutorial to demonstrate the deployment process is 
a simple Python app printing the current time to stdout.

Clone the application to your development environment.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/viktorsapozhok/kubernetes-cronjob-tutorial.git
```

Then go to the project directory and install the application.

```shell
$ cd kubernetes-cronjob-tutorial
$ pip install .
```

When its installed, you can verify the installation calling `myapp` from the command line.

```shell
$ myapp --help
Usage: myapp [OPTIONS]

  Demo app printing current time to stdout.

Options:
  --job TEXT  Job name
  --help      Show this message and exit.
```

Run it, to print the current time to console:

```shell
$ myapp --job JOB-1 
15:42:36: JOB-1 started
```

Application is installed to your development environment. Now we can start
preparing it to the deployment.

## 2. Install docker and docker-compose

Skip this section and go to the section 3, if you already have docker installed.

Update software repositories to make sure youâ€™ve got access to the latest revisions.
Then install docker engine.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install docker.io
```

Now we set up docker service to be running at startup.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start docker
$ sudo systemctl enable docker
```

You can test the installation verifying docker version.

```bash
$ sudo docker --version
```

By default, the docker daemon always run as `root` user and other users can access it
only with `sudo` privileges. To be able to run docker as non-root user, create a new group
called `docker` and add your user to it.

```bash
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and log back in so that group membership is re-evaluated.
You can also issue the following command to activate changes.

```bash
$ newgrp docker
```

Verify if docker can be run as non-root.

```bash
$ docker run hello-world
```

Reboot if you got error.

Now, after docker engine is installed, we install docker compose, a tool for
defining and running multi-container docker applications. 

Follow the [official installation guide][2] and test the installation verifying compose version.

```bash
$ docker-compose --version
```

## 3. Create docker image for your Python app
